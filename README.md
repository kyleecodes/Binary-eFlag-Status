# eFlagStatus.asm

This was an assignment for college where I had to build an Assembly program that displayed the status of eflags when given certain operations. Keeping this description minimal for my professors sake. This program was written in 1259 lines of Assembly code using the MASM (Microsoft's Macro Assembler) in Visual Studio Code. The Irvine library must be installed in the same directory in order for this to run properly.
